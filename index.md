# Engineering @ Furrble
{: .fs-9 }

Even when we are just a pet and lifestyle brand, we have to do things very differently in order to make that difference. We use cutting edge tools and technologies and solve problems with complexity ranging from O(1) to NP-Hard.

We take pride in our Engineering Efforts and that is what drives us miles apart from every other pet brand. Technology has the power to change not just human but animal lives as well.

## What to look for?

These docs are not just for showing off what we do (Well, you have to at some point! :p), but also for the internal use. This can contain all the very basic to advanced stuff. Just search whatever you are confused about!

If you want to read fun articles about pets, go read the Fables blog!
